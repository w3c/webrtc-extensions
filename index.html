    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This document contains proposed extensions to the [[WEBRTC]] specification,
      where it was thought inappropriate to incorporate them directly into that specification
      at the point in time when they were written, but they were too small to warrant
      writing a separate document.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, at a later time, it is a good time to add them to the base specification, that
      will be done. Deciding factors will include maturity of the extension, consensus on
      adding it, and implementation experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document contains a number of sections that have extensions for one specific
      interface or dictionary in the base specification. When an extension only affects
      one interface or dictionary, it will only be described there. If an extension affects
      multiple interfaces or dictionaries, there will be a subsection in the informative
      "Overviews" section that describes the extension as a whole, while the normative changes
      are in the sections for the individual interfaces.

      <h3>RTP header control</h3>
      <p>
        The extension for RTP header extension control consists of 2 parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An extension to RTCRtpTransceiver, to set and query the RTP header extensions
          negotiated in SDP.
        </li>
        <li>An extension to RTCRtpHeaderExtensionParameters, to be used with setParameters()
          to set the RTP header extensions sent by an RTCRtpSender.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The RTP header extension mechanism is defined in [[RFC8285]], with
        the SDP negotiation mechanism defined in section 5. It goes into some
        detail on the meaning of "direction" with regard to RTP header
        extensions, and gives a detailed procedure for negotiating RTP header
        extension IDs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This API extension gives the means to control the use and direction of
        RTP header extensions as documented in [[RFC8285]]. It does not
        influence the ID negotiation mechanism, except for being able to
        control the number of extensions offered.

      interface is defined in [[WEBRTC]]. This document extends that interface

      Let [[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]] be an internal slot of the RTCRtpTransceiver,
      initialized to the platform-specific list of implemented RTP header extensions.
      The direction
      attribute for all extensions that are mandatory to use MUST be initialized to
      an appropriate value other than "stopped". The direction attribute for extensions
      that will not be offered by default in an initial offer MUST be initialized to
      "stopped".
    </p>
    <p class="note">The list of header extensions that MUST/SHOULD be supported is listed in
      [[RTCWEB-RTP]], section 5.2. The "mid" extension is mandatory to use when

      <h2>Modifications to existing procedures</h2>
      <p>
        In the <a>set an RTCSessionDescription</a> algorithm, add a step
        right after the step that sets transceiver.[[\Sender]].[[\SendCodecs]],
        saying "For each transciever, set [[\HeaderExtensionsNegotiated]] to
        an empty list, and then
        for each "a=hdrext" line, add an appropriate
        RTCRtpHeaderExtensionCapability to the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the algorithms for generating initial offers in [[RTCWEB-JSEP]] section 5.2.1,
        replace "for each supported RTP header extension, an "a=extmap" line, as specified in
        [[RFC5285]], section 5" " with "For each RTP header extension "e"
        listed in [[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]] where direction is not "stopped", an "a=extmap"
        line, as specified in [[RFC5285]], section 5, with direction taken from "e"'s direction
        attribute."
      </p>
      <p>
        In the algorithm for generating subsequent offers in [[RTCWEB-JSEP]] section 5.2.2, replace "The
        RTP header extensions MUST only include those that are present in the most recent answer"
        with "For each RTP header extension listed in [[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]] that is
        also present in the most recent answer, and where direction is not "stopped", generate
        an appropriate "a=extmap" line with "direction" set according to the rules of [[RFC5285]]
        section 6, considering the direction in [[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]] to indicate the
        answerer's desired usage". This preserves the property that the set of extensions
        may not grow with subsequent offers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the algorithm for generating initial answers in [[RTCWEB-JSEP]] section 5.3.1, replace "For
        each supported RTP header extension that is present in the offer" with "For each
        supported RTP header extension that is present in the offer and is also present in
        [[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]] with a direction different from "stopped"".
      </p>

        Since JSEP does not know about WebRTC internal slots, merging this change requires
        more work on a JSEP revision.

          Agent to perform more or less buffering than it might otherwise do.
          This allows to influence the tradeoffs between having a higher delay
          and the risk that buffers such as the jitter buffer will run out of
          audio or video frames to play due to network jitter.</p>

          WebRTC only handles the interaction between the <a>ICE

          the OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant type, with PoP (Proof-of-Possession)
          Token type, as described in [[RFC6749]] and

          <p class="note">According to [[RFC7635]] Section 4.1, the
          HMAC key MUST be a symmetric key, as asymmetric keys would
          result in large access tokens which may not fit in a single

      In a direct connection, the <a>capture system</a> is the same as the

      media is sourced from the <a>capture system</a>, may be relayed through a
      number of intermediate systems and is then finally sent from the
      <a>sender system</a> to the <a>receiver system</a>. The
      <a>sender system</a>-<a>receiver system</a> path only represents the
      "last hop".

      time of playout can be estimated if the
      <a>RTP Header Extension for Absolute Capture Time</a> is used all hops of
      the way, where each RTCP-terminating intermediate system appropriately
