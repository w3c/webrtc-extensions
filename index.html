    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This document contains proposed extensions to the [[WEBRTC]] specification,
      where it was thought inappropriate to incorporate them directly into that specification
      at the point in time when they were written, but they were too small to warrant
      writing a separate document.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, at a later time, it is a good time to add them to the base specification, that
      will be done. Deciding factors will include maturity of the extension, consensus on
      adding it, and implementation experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document contains a number of sections that have extensions for one specific
      interface or dictionary in the base specification. When an extension only affects
      one interface or dictionary, it will only be described there. If an extension affects
      multiple interfaces or dictionaries, there will be a subsection in the informative
      "Overviews" section that describes the extension as a whole, while the normative changes
      are in the sections for the individual interfaces.

      <h3>RTP header control</h3>
      <p>
        The extension for RTP header extension control consists of 2 parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An extension to {{RTCRtpTransceiver}}, to set and query the RTP header extensions
          negotiated in SDP.
        </li>
        <li>An extension to {{RTCRtpHeaderExtensionParameters}}, to be used with setParameters()
          to set the RTP header extensions sent by an {{RTCRtpSender}}.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The RTP header extension mechanism is defined in [[RFC8285]], with
        the SDP negotiation mechanism defined in section 5. It goes into some
        detail on the meaning of "direction" with regard to RTP header
        extensions, and gives a detailed procedure for negotiating RTP header
        extension IDs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This API extension gives the means to control the use and direction of
        RTP header extensions as documented in [[RFC8285]]. It does not
        influence the ID negotiation mechanism, except for being able to
        control the number of extensions offered.

      The {{RTCRtpTransceiver}}

      by adding an additional method and attribute in order to control negotiation of
      RTP header extensions.

      an appropriate value other than "stopped". The direction attribute for extensions
      that will not be offered by default in an initial offer MUST be initialized to

      <p>
        In the <a data-cite="WEBRTC#set-description">set a session description</a> algorithm, add a step
        right after the step that sets transceiver.[[\Sender]].[[\SendCodecs]],
        saying "For each transciever, set [[\HeaderExtensionsNegotiated]] to
        an empty list, and then
        for each "a=hdrext" line, add an appropriate
        RTCRtpHeaderExtensionCapability to the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the algorithms for generating initial offers in [[RTCWEB-JSEP]] section 5.2.1,
        replace "for each supported RTP header extension, an "a=extmap" line, as specified in
        [[RFC5285]], section 5" " with "For each RTP header extension "e"
        listed in [[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]] where direction is not "stopped", an "a=extmap"
        line, as specified in [[RFC5285]], section 5, with direction taken from "e"'s direction
        attribute."
      </p>
      <p>
        In the algorithm for generating subsequent offers in [[RTCWEB-JSEP]] section 5.2.2, replace "The
        RTP header extensions MUST only include those that are present in the most recent answer"
        with "For each RTP header extension listed in [[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]] that is
        also present in the most recent answer, and where direction is not "stopped", generate
        an appropriate "a=extmap" line with "direction" set according to the rules of [[RFC5285]]
        section 6, considering the direction in [[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]] to indicate the
        answerer's desired usage". This preserves the property that the set of extensions
        may not grow with subsequent offers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the algorithm for generating initial answers in [[RTCWEB-JSEP]] section 5.3.1, replace "For
        each supported RTP header extension that is present in the offer" with "For each
        supported RTP header extension that is present in the offer and is also present in
        [[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]] with a direction different from "stopped"".
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Since JSEP does not know about WebRTC internal slots, merging this change requires
        more work on a JSEP revision.

          <p>This attribute allows the application to specify a target duration
          of time between network reception of media and playout. The
          User Agent SHOULD NOT playout audio or video that is received unless
          this amount of time has passed in seconds, allowing the User
          Agent to perform more or less buffering than it might otherwise do.
          This allows to influence the tradeoffs between having a higher delay
          and the risk that buffers such as the jitter buffer will run out of
          audio or video frames to play due to network jitter.</p>
          <p>The User Agent may have a <dfn>minimum allowed delay</dfn> and a

          constraints.</p>
          <p class="note">
            The playout delay hint applies even if DTX is used. For example, if

            influence the User Agent to buffer these packets rather than playing
            them out.

            synchronization mechanism will automatically delay all others
            paired tracks. If multiple such paired tracks are delayed through
            <a>[[\PlayoutDelay]]</a> by different amounts then the largest
            of those hints will take precedence in synchronization mechanism.
          </p>
          <p class="note">

            Authenticated encryption is used for message encryption and
