      This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to extend the WebRTC 1.0 API.

    <p>The API is based on preliminary work done in the W3C WEBRTC Working Group.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This document contains proposed extensions to the [[WEBRTC]] specification.
      Some of these extensions were originally included within the [[WEBRTC]] specification,
      but needed to be removed due to lack of implementation experience. Others were not
      sufficiently mature to be incorporated into that specification when they were developed,
      but were too small to warrant creation of a separate document.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document contains some sections extending one specific interface or dictionary in
      the base specification; in this case the extension is only described in an individual
      section. Where an extension affects multiple interfaces or dictionaries, a subsection
      in the "Overviews" section describes the extension as a whole, while normative text
      is provided in sections relating to the individual interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      As extensions mature and gain implementation experience, they may move from this document
      to the base specification if WG consensus emerges to do so.

  <section id="conformance">
    <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
    product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that it
    contains.</p>
    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
    implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
    particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
    easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>
    <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
    this specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the
    ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[WEBIDL]], as
    this specification uses that specification and terminology.</p>

    <h2>RTP header extension control</h2>
    <p>
      RTP header extension control is an extension to {{RTCRtpTransceiver}} that allows
      to set and query the RTP header extensions supported and negotiated in SDP.
    <p>
      The RTP header extension mechanism is defined in [[RFC8285]], with
      the SDP negotiation mechanism defined in section 5. It goes into some
      detail on the meaning of "direction" with regard to RTP header
      extensions, and gives a detailed procedure for negotiating RTP header
      extension IDs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This API extension gives the means to control the use and direction of
      RTP header extensions as documented in [[RFC8285]]. It does not
      influence the ID negotiation mechanism, except for being able to
      control the number of extensions offered.

          <p>This attribute allows the application to specify a target duration
          of time in milliseconds of media for the {{RTCRtpReceiver}}'s jitter
          buffer to hold. This influences the amount of buffering done by the
          <a>user agent</a>, which in turn affects retransmissions and packet loss
          recovery. Altering the target value allows applications to control the
          tradeoff between playout delay and the risk of running out of audio or
          video frames due to network jitter.

          <p>The <a>user agent</a> MUST have a <dfn>minimum allowed target</dfn> and a
          <dfn>maximum allowed target</dfn> reflecting what the <a>user agent</a> is
          able or willing to provide based on network conditions and memory
          constraints, which can change at any time.</p>
          <div class="note">
            <p>This is a target value. The resulting change in delay can be gradually
            observed over time. The receiver's average jitter buffer delay can be
            measured as the delta
            {{RTCInboundRtpStreamStats/jitterBufferDelay}} divided by the delta
            {{RTCInboundRtpStreamStats/jitterBufferEmittedCount}}.
            </p>
            <p>
            An average delay is expected even if DTX is used. For example, if
            DTX is used and packets start flowing after silence, larger targets can
            influence the <a>user agent</a> to buffer these packets rather than
            playing them out.

      The {{RTCRtpContributingSource}} dictionary is defined in [[WEBRTC]]. This
      document extends that dictionary by adding two additional members.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, the <dfn>capture system</dfn> refers to the system where
      media is sourced from and the <dfn>sender system</dfn> refers to the
      system that is sending RTP and RTCP packets to the
      <dfn>receiver system</dfn> where {{RTCRtpContributingSource}} data is
      populated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a direct connection, the <a>capture system</a> is the same as the
      <a>sender system</a>. But when one or more RTCP-terminating intermediate
      systems (e.g. mixers) are involved this is not the case. In such cases,
      media is sourced from the <a>capture system</a>, may be relayed through a
      number of intermediate systems and is then finally sent from the
      <a>sender system</a> to the <a>receiver system</a>. The
      <a>sender system</a>-<a>receiver system</a> path only represents the
      "last hop".
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite {{RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats.roundTripTime}}
      measurements only accounting for the "last hop", one-way delay from the
      [=capture system=]'s time of capture to the [=receiver system=]'s
      time of playout can be estimated if the
      [=RTP Header Extension for Absolute Capture Time=] is used all hops of
      the way, where each RTCP-terminating intermediate system appropriately
      updates the [=estimated capture clock offset=].

    <h2>Disabling hardware acceleration</h2>
    <p>
      While hardware acceleration of video encoding and decoding is generally desirable, it has proven to be
      operationally challenging to achieve in the environment of a browser with no detailed information about
      the underlying hardware. In some cases, falling back to software encoding yields better results.
    <p>
    <p class="note">
      The methods specified in this section should be used sparingly and not for extended amounts of time.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      In privacy-sensitive contexts, browsers may disable hardware acceleration by default to
      reduce the fingerprinting surface.
