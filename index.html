      This document defines a set of ECMAScript APIs in WebIDL to extend the WebRTC 1.0 API.

    <p>The API is based on preliminary work done in the W3C WEBRTC Working Group.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This document contains proposed extensions to the [[WEBRTC]] specification.
      Some of these extensions were originally included within the [[WEBRTC]] specification,
      but needed to be removed due to lack of implementation experience. Others were not
      sufficiently mature to be incorporated into that specification when they were developed,
      but were too small to warrant creation of a separate document.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document contains some sections extending one specific interface or dictionary in
      the base specification; in this case the extension is only described in an individual
      section. Where an extension affects multiple interfaces or dictionaries, a subsection
      in the "Overviews" section describes the extension as a whole, while normative text
      is provided in sections relating to the individual interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      As extensions mature and gain implementation experience, they may move from this document
      to the base specification if WG consensus emerges to do so.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="conformance">
    <p>This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
    product: the <dfn>user agent</dfn> that implements the interfaces that it
    contains.</p>
    <p>Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be
    implemented in any manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In
    particular, the algorithms defined in this specification are intended to be
    easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)</p>
    <p>Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
    this specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the
    ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[WEBIDL]], as
    this specification uses that specification and terminology.</p>

      <h3>RTP header control</h3>
      <p>
        RTP header extension control is an extension to {{RTCRtpTransceiver}} that allows
        to set and query the RTP header extensions supported and negotiated in SDP.
      <p>
        The RTP header extension mechanism is defined in [[RFC8285]], with
        the SDP negotiation mechanism defined in section 5. It goes into some
        detail on the meaning of "direction" with regard to RTP header
        extensions, and gives a detailed procedure for negotiating RTP header
        extension IDs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This API extension gives the means to control the use and direction of
        RTP header extensions as documented in [[RFC8285]]. It does not
        influence the ID negotiation mechanism, except for being able to
        control the number of extensions offered.

      class="attributes">
        <dt><dfn>playoutDelay</dfn> of type <span
          class="idlAttrType">double</span>, nullable</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>This attribute allows the application to specify a target duration
          of time between network reception of media and playout. The
          <a>user agent</a> SHOULD NOT playout audio or video that is received unless
          this amount of time has passed in seconds, allowing the <a>user agent</a>
          to perform more or less buffering than it might otherwise do.
          This allows to influence the tradeoffs between having a higher delay
          and the risk that buffers such as the jitter buffer will run out of
          audio or video frames to play due to network jitter.</p>
          <p>The <a>user agent</a> may have a <dfn>minimum allowed delay</dfn> and a
          <dfn>maximum allowed delay</dfn> reflecting what the <a>user agent</a> is
          able or willing to provide based on network conditions and memory
          constraints.</p>
          <p class="note">
            The playout delay hint applies even if DTX is used. For example, if
            DTX is used and packets start flowing after silence, the hint can
            influence the <a>user agent</a> to buffer these packets rather than playing
            them out.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            If the track is paired with other tracks through
            {{RTCRtpReceiver}}
            <a data-cite="WEBRTC#dfn-associatedremotemediastreams">
            [[\AssociatedRemoteMediaStreams]]</a> internal slot, then it will
            be synchronized with other tracks (for e.g. audio video
            synchronization). This means that even if one of the paired tracks
            is delayed through {{RTCRtpReceiver/[[PlayoutDelay]]}} then the <a>user agent</a>
            synchronization mechanism will automatically delay all others
            paired tracks. If multiple such paired tracks are delayed through
            {{RTCRtpReceiver/[[PlayoutDelay]]}} by different amounts then the largest
            of those hints will take precedence in synchronization mechanism.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            The receiver's average delay can be measured as the delta
            {{RTCInboundRtpStreamStats/jitterBufferDelay}} divided by the delta
            {{RTCInboundRtpStreamStats/jitterBufferEmittedCount}}.
          </p>
          <p>On getting, this attribute MUST return the value of the
          {{RTCRtpReceiver/[[PlayoutDelay]]}} internal slot.</p>
          <p>On setting, the <a>user agent</a> MUST run the following steps:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Let <var>receiver</var> be the

                  possible to the requested one.</p>
                  <p class="note">
                    If the <a>user agent</a> chooses a delay different from the requested
                    one (e.g. due to network conditions or physical memory

                  second of buffering but SHOULD not take more than 30 seconds
                  assuming packets are being received. The speed MAY be

      The {{RTCRtpContributingSource}} dictionary is defined in [[WEBRTC]]. This
      document extends that dictionary by adding two additional members.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, the <dfn>capture system</dfn> refers to the system where
      media is sourced from and the <dfn>sender system</dfn> refers to the
      system that is sending RTP and RTCP packets to the
      <dfn>receiver system</dfn> where {{RTCRtpContributingSource}} data is
      populated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a direct connection, the <a>capture system</a> is the same as the
      <a>sender system</a>. But when one or more RTCP-terminating intermediate
      systems (e.g. mixers) are involved this is not the case. In such cases,
      media is sourced from the <a>capture system</a>, may be relayed through a
      number of intermediate systems and is then finally sent from the
      <a>sender system</a> to the <a>receiver system</a>. The
      <a>sender system</a>-<a>receiver system</a> path only represents the
      "last hop".
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite {{RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats.roundTripTime}}
      measurements only accounting for the "last hop", one-way delay from the
      [=capture system=]'s time of capture to the [=receiver system=]'s
      time of playout can be estimated if the
      [=RTP Header Extension for Absolute Capture Time=] is used all hops of
      the way, where each RTCP-terminating intermediate system appropriately
      updates the [=estimated capture clock offset=].

          placed in the {{RTCOAuthCredential}} dictionary.

          <p class="note">
          This specification does not define how an application (acting

          <code>accessToken</code>, <code>kid</code> and
          <code>macKey</code> from the [=Authorization Server=], as
          WebRTC only handles the interaction between the <a data-cite="WEBRTC#dfn-ice-agent">ICE
          Agent</a> and TURN server. For example, the application may use
          the OAuth 2.0 Implicit Grant type, with PoP (Proof-of-Possession)
          Token type, as described in [[RFC6749]] and
          [[OAUTH-POP-KEY-DISTRIBUTION]]; an example of this is provided

          <p>
          The application, acting as the <a>OAuth Client</a>, is responsible for

          Agent</a> with fresh new credentials before the
          <code>accessToken</code> expires. The <a>OAuth Client</a> can use the

          <p class="note">According to [[RFC7635]] Section 4.1, the
          HMAC key MUST be a symmetric key, as asymmetric keys would
          result in large access tokens which may not fit in a single
          STUN message.</p>
          <p class="note">Currently the STUN/TURN protocols use only SHA-1 and SHA-2
          family hash algorithms for Message Integrity Protection, as

            provides expiry information; this information describes the
