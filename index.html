    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This document contains proposed extensions to the [[WEBRTC]] specification,
      where it was thought inappropriate to incorporate them directly into that specification
      at the point in time when they were written, but they were too small to warrant
      writing a separate document.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, at a later time, it is a good time to add them to the base specification, that
      will be done. Deciding factors will include maturity of the extension, consensus on
      adding it, and implementation experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      This document contains a number of sections that have extensions for one specific
      interface or dictionary in the base specification. When an extension only affects
      one interface or dictionary, it will only be described there. If an extension affects
      multiple interfaces or dictionaries, there will be a subsection in the informative
      "Overviews" section that describes the extension as a whole, while the normative changes
      are in the sections for the individual interfaces.

      <h3>RTP header control</h3>
      <p>
        The extension for RTP header extension control consists of 2 parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An extension to RTCRtpTransceiver, to set and query the RTP header extensions
          negotiated in SDP.
        </li>
        <li>An extension to RTCRtpHeaderExtensionParameters, to be used with setParameters()
          to set the RTP header extensions sent by an RTCRtpSender.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The RTP header extension mechanism is defined in [[RFC8285]], with
        the SDP negotiation mechanism defined in section 5. It goes into some
        detail on the meaning of "direction" with regard to RTP header
        extensions, and gives a detailed procedure for negotiating RTP header
        extension IDs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This API extension gives the means to control the use and direction of
        RTP header extensions as documented in [[RFC8285]]. It does not
        influence the ID negotiation mechanism, except for being able to
        control the number of extensions offered.

      The <code><a href="https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-pc/#dom-rtcrtptransceiver">RTCRtpTransceiver</a></code>
      interface is defined in [[WEBRTC]]. This document extends that interface

      Let [[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]] be an internal slot of the RTCRtpTransceiver,
      initialized to the platform-specific list of implemented RTP header extensions.
      The direction
      attribute for all extensions that are mandatory to use MUST be initialized to
      an appropriate value other than "stopped". The direction attribute for extensions
      that will not be offered by default in an initial offer MUST be initialized to
      "stopped".
    </p>
    <p class="note">The list of header extensions that MUST/SHOULD be supported is listed in
      [[RTCWEB-RTP]], section 5.2. The "mid" extension is mandatory to use when
      BUNDLE is in use, per [[BUNDLE]] section 9.1.

      <h2>Modifications to existing procedures</h2>
      <p>
        In the <a>set an RTCSessionDescription</a> algorithm, add a step
        right after the step that sets transceiver.[[\Sender]].[[\SendCodecs]],
        saying "For each transciever, set [[\HeaderExtensionsNegotiated]] to
        an empty list, and then
        for each "a=hdrext" line, add an appropriate
        RTCRtpHeaderExtensionCapability to the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the algorithms for generating initial offers in [[RTCWEB-JSEP]] section 5.2.1,
        replace "for each supported RTP header extension, an "a=extmap" line, as specified in
        [[RFC5285]], section 5" " with "For each RTP header extension "e"
        listed in [[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]] where direction is not "stopped", an "a=extmap"
        line, as specified in [[RFC5285]], section 5, with direction taken from "e"'s direction
        attribute."
      </p>
      <p>
        In the algorithm for generating subsequent offers in [[RTCWEB-JSEP]] section 5.2.2, replace "The
        RTP header extensions MUST only include those that are present in the most recent answer"
        with "For each RTP header extension listed in [[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]] that is
        also present in the most recent answer, and where direction is not "stopped", generate
        an appropriate "a=extmap" line with "direction" set according to the rules of [[RFC5285]]
        section 6, considering the direction in [[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]] to indicate the
        answerer's desired usage". This preserves the property that the set of extensions
        may not grow with subsequent offers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the algorithm for generating initial answers in [[RTCWEB-JSEP]] section 5.3.1, replace "For
        each supported RTP header extension that is present in the offer" with "For each
        supported RTP header extension that is present in the offer and is also present in
        [[\HeaderExtensionsToOffer]] with a direction different from "stopped"".
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Since JSEP does not know about WebRTC internal slots, merging this change requires
        more work on a JSEP revision.

      The {{RTCRtpReceiver}}

      by adding an additional internal slot and attribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <code>RTCRtpReceiver</code> objects have a
      <dfn>[[\PlayoutDelay]]</dfn> internal slot initially

          class="idlAttrType">double</span>, nullable</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>This attribute allows the application to specify a target duration
          of time between network reception of media and playout. The
          User Agent SHOULD NOT playout audio or video that is received unless
          this amount of time has passed in seconds, allowing the User
          Agent to perform more or less buffering than it might otherwise do.
          This allows to influence the tradeoffs between having a higher delay
          and the risk that buffers such as the jitter buffer will run out of
          audio or video frames to play due to network jitter.</p>
          <p>The User Agent may have a <dfn>minimum allowed delay</dfn> and a
          <dfn>maximum allowed delay</dfn> reflecting what the User Agent is
          able or willing to provide based on network conditions and memory
          constraints.</p>
          <p class="note">
            The playout delay hint applies even if DTX is used. For example, if
            DTX is used and packets start flowing after silence, the hint can
            influence the User Agent to buffer these packets rather than playing
            them out.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            If the track is paired with other tracks through

            be synchronized with other tracks (for e.g. audio video
            synchronization). This means that even if one of the paired tracks
            is delayed through [[\PlayoutDelay]] then the User Agent
            synchronization mechanism will automatically delay all others
            paired tracks. If multiple such paired tracks are delayed through
            <a>[[\PlayoutDelay]]</a> by different amounts then the largest
            of those hints will take precedence in synchronization mechanism.
          </p>
          <p class="note">
            The receiver's average delay can be measured as the delta
            <code><a href="https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-stats/#dom-rtcinboundrtpstreamstats-jitterbufferdelay">

          <p>On getting, this attribute MUST return the value of the
          <a>[[\PlayoutDelay]]</a> internal slot.</p>
          <p>On setting, the User Agent MUST run the following steps:</p>

              <p>Let <var>receiver</var> be the

              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>Update the underlying system about the new delay request,

                  delay</a> or <a>maximum allowed delay</a> to be as close as
                  possible to the requested one.</p>
                  <p class="note">
                    If User Agent chooses delay different from requested one,

                  be accelerated or decelerated before playout, similarly to how

                  <p>The acceleration or deceleration rate may vary depending on
                  network conditions or the type of audio received (e.g. speech
                  or background noise). It MAY take several seconds to achieve 1

                  assuming packets are being received. The speed MAY be

                  <p class="note">
                    For audio, acceleration and deceleration can be measured

      The {{RTCRtpContributingSource}} dictionary is defined in [[WEBRTC]]. This
      document extends that dictionary by adding two additional members.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this section, the <dfn>capture system</dfn> refers to the system where
      media is sourced from and the <dfn>sender system</dfn> refers to the
      system that is sending RTP and RTCP packets to the
      <dfn>receiver system</dfn> where {{RTCRtpContributingSource}} data is
      populated.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a direct connection, the <a>capture system</a> is the same as the
      <a>sender system</a>. But when one or more RTCP-terminating intermediate
      systems (e.g. mixers) are involved this is not the case. In such cases,
      media is sourced from the <a>capture system</a>, may be relayed through a
      number of intermediate systems and is then finally sent from the
      <a>sender system</a> to the <a>receiver system</a>. The
      <a>sender system</a>-<a>receiver system</a> path only represents the
      "last hop".
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite <a><code>RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats.roundTripTime</code></a>
      measurements only accounting for the "last hop", one-way delay from the
      <a>capture system</a>'s time of capture to the <a>receiver system</a>'s
      time of playout can be estimated if the
      <a>RTP Header Extension for Absolute Capture Time</a> is used all hops of
      the way, where each RTCP-terminating intermediate system appropriately
      updates the <a>estimated capture clock offset</a>.

          The {{captureTimestamp}} is the timestamp that, the most recent frame
          (from an RTP packet originating from this source) delivered to the
          {{RTCRtpReceiver}}'s {{MediaStreamTrack}}, was originally captured.
          Its reference clock is the <a>capture system</a>'s NTP clock (same
          clock used to generate NTP timestamps for RTCP sender reports on that
          system).
        </p>
        <p>
          On populating this member, the user agent MUST run the following

          <li>
            <p>If the relevant RTP packet contains the
            <a>RTP Header Extension for Absolute Capture Time</a>, return the
            value of the <a>absolute capture timestamp</a> field and abort
            these steps.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Otherwise, if the relevant RTP packet does not contain the
            <a>RTP Header Extension for Absolute Capture Time</a> but a
            previous RTP packet did, return the result of calculating the
            absolute capture timestamp according to
            <a>timestamp interpolation</a> and abort these steps.</p>

        <p class="note">
          If multiple receiving tracks are sourced from the same
          <a>capture system</a>, two {{captureTimestamp}}s can be used to
          accurately measure audio-video synchronization since both timestamps
          are based on the same system's clock.
